      <description>When we don&amp;rsquo;t want to run a shell with sudo but still want to redirect output to a location we don&amp;rsquo;t have permission to access we can use the sudo tee trick.
$ sudo cat /root/file | sudo tee /whatever/test.out &amp;gt; /dev/null The redirect to /dev/null is there to stop tee from outputting to the screen.
We have to use sudo with tee because a normal redirection performed by the shell is running with our users permissions.</description>

      <description>TIL about the status bar on iTerm2. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty useful with a mix of builtin components like Current Directory or git state and user defined variables or functions. To access and configure the status bar go to Preferences &amp;gt; Profiles &amp;gt; Session. Turn on Status bar enabled then click Configure Status Bar.
Again, scripting plays a huge part in how useful the status bar is.
As an example:
# In ~/.</description>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/curl-data/</guid>
      <description>TIL that curl --data and curl --data-binary when used with a @filename outputs a different result. The most common one being that --data will strip newlines from the file but --data-binary will not.</description>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/uuencode/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the uuencode and uudecode command utilities. It allows us to decode and encode binary files respectively.
$ echo &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39; | uuencode -o my_binary my_binary $ file my_binary my_binary: uuencoded or xxencoded text, ASCII text $ cat my_binary begin 644 my_binary $9F]O&amp;#34;@`` ` end $uudecode my_binary $cat my_binary foo </description>

      <title>cp -u flag</title>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/cp-u-flag/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the -u flag for cp. It will only copy files that don&amp;rsquo;t exist, or are newer than their existing counterparts in the destination directory.
$ cp -u *.txt app_dir It&amp;rsquo;s a nice replacement to the interactive flag (-i) if we know we want this behaviour.</description>

      <description>TIL about the rename command utility. It allows us to rename files using a Perl Common Regular Expression. Suppose we have the following files:
$ ls temp1.txt	temp2.txt	temp3.txt Now we want to rename our files from temp to final, but are not really sure how to craft our regular expression. In this case we can use the -n flag:
$ rename -n &amp;#39;s/temp/final/&amp;#39; *.txt &amp;#39;temp1.txt&amp;#39; would be renamed to &amp;#39;final1.</description>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/tldr-pages/</guid>
      <description>TIL about tldr pages, a collection of simplified and community-driven man pages.
It&amp;rsquo;s especially useful when we already know that we need a certain tool but forgot exactly which way to use it. Going through man mytool can be a slow process sometimes.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see a tldr lsof example:
$ tldr lsof lsof Lists open files and the corresponding processes. Note: Root privileges (or sudo) is required to list files opened by others.</description>

      <title>jot command</title>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/jot-command/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the jot command. It allows us to print sequential or random data.
The basic option has the format jot [numbers] [start_with] $ jot 3 10 10 11 12
or if you want to generate random data: jot -r [numbers] [lower_limit] [upper_limit]
$ jot -r 3 1 20 5 12 19 Not all of the flags are covered here, man jot does a good job explaining them.</description>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/at-command/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the at command. It allows us to schedule commands to be executed at a later time.
$ echo &amp;#34;bla&amp;#34; | at now + 5 minutes or if you want to execute commands from a file later on:
$ at -f path/to/file 9:30 PM Tue We can type atq to see existing jobs. For more information check man or tldr, it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting suite of commands.</description>

      <title>The ps -o flag</title>
      <link>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/ps-option/</link>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/ps-option/</guid>
      <description>The ps command is well known for displaying process information, but it was only recently that I found out about the useful -o flag. What this flag does is display the information about one or more selected headers.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example where we display the rss (Resident Set Size) for the process with pid 5380:
$ ps -o rss -p 5380 RSS 1784  rss represents the real memory, that is, the process&amp;rsquo;s memory that is held in RAM.</description>

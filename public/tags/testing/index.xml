      <description>TIL about running tests through a spawned database instance off a RAM disk. This has been applied for a long time, but completely flew under my radar. An early example of this setup with Rails and MySQL can be seen here.
The idea is to make your test databaseâ€™s storage live in memory instead of on-disk since it makes for faster reads and writes, even when considering the use of SSD.</description>

      <description>TIL about recursive macros in vim. As the name implies, it consists of calling your macro within the macro your are building. Pre-requisites:
 Having a clear register (qa -&amp;gt; q to clear register a) Having a break point through t or f if we don&amp;rsquo;t want to run on all lines  Suppose we have the following file:
1 abc,123 2 bcd,4 3 cde,54321 4 def,88 And we want the end result to be:</description>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/vim-scriptnames/</guid>
      <description>TIL about :scriptnames in order to get a list of scripts that vim has loaded. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty useful since we can infer if any of our scripts are being overridden by another one. We can also run this command as scr</description>

      <description>TIL that in normal mode we can just type a percentage and vim will go there, like 50% or 75%.</description>

      <title>async run</title>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/quickfix-reflector/</guid>
      <description>TIL about quickfix-reflector to make the quickfix window modifiable. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it in conjunction with plugins like fzf.vim and async-run that writes to the quickfix window, after that the plugin makes commands like :w and :x reflect the action to every file listed in the quickfix window. It&amp;rsquo;s a great plugin to enable search and replace, allowing things like replacing words through regular expressions across files in a very convenient way.</description>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/async-run/</guid>
      <description>TIL about async run to run shell commands asynchronously in Vim 8 or NeoVim. The output of the shell command can be read in real time using the quickfix window. Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example:
&amp;#34; Running the command asynchronously:AsyncRun git push origin master&amp;#34; Opening the quickfix window:copen An interesting option is to set g:asyncrun_open with a value like 8 to open the quickfix window automatically with a certain height when an asynchronous command is running.</description>

      <title>Vim :normal</title>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/vim-normal-command/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes it is useful to use the :normal command in VIM, what it does is accept a sequence of keys and pretend they were typed in normal mode.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this works with a quick example. Suppose we have a file like the following:
1 abc,123 2 bcd,4 3 cde,54321 4 def,88 And we want the end result to be:
hash[&amp;#34;abc&amp;#34;] = 123 hash[&amp;#34;bcd&amp;#34;] = 4 hash[&amp;#34;cde&amp;#34;] = 54321 hash[&amp;#34;def&amp;#34;] = 88 To solve this in one command we can select the lines we want to modify and use:</description>

      <description>TIL about the &amp;amp; command in Vim and how it can be used to repeat the last search and replace pattern.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this works with a quick example. Suppose we have a file like the following:
rock paper scissors rock paper scissors rock paper scissors And you want to replace the word rock with lizard just in the lines one and three (don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why). Normally I would do something like:</description>

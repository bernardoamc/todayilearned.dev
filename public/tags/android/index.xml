      <description>TIL Android has a tool called procrank (/system/xbin/procrank), which lists out the memory usage of Linux processes in order from highest to lowest usage. The sizes reported per process are VSS, RSS, PSS, and USS.
VSS
 is the total accessible address space of a process.  RSS
 is the total memory actually held in RAM for a process, including shared libraries.  PSS
 same as RSS, but reports the proportional size of its shared libraries.</description>

      <title>will change</title>

      <description>TIL about the will-change CSS property. It provides hints to browsers about how an element is expected to change. Browsers may set up optimizations before an element is actually changed.
.sidebar { will-change: transform; } *This property should be used as a last resort, try to optimize before relying on it.
For example, avoid transitions with top/right/bottom/left properties as they force the browser to create layouts every time.</description>

      <title>unescape() room</title>

      <description>TIL about unescape() room, a game that helps we improve our Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) skills through challenges.
It&amp;rsquo;s based on real world examples and becomes increasingly more difficult as each level progress. The page links to a video that explains the vulnerability and helps us to start the game. Give it a try!</description>

      <title>tldr pages</title>

      <description>TIL about tldr pages, a collection of simplified and community-driven man pages.
It&amp;rsquo;s especially useful when we already know that we need a certain tool but forgot exactly which way to use it. Going through man mytool can be a slow process sometimes.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see a tldr lsof example:
$ tldr lsof lsof Lists open files and the corresponding processes. Note: Root privileges (or sudo) is required to list files opened by others.</description>

      <title>jot command</title>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/jot-command/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the jot command. It allows us to print sequential or random data.
The basic option has the format jot [numbers] [start_with] $ jot 3 10 10 11 12
or if you want to generate random data: jot -r [numbers] [lower_limit] [upper_limit]
$ jot -r 3 1 20 5 12 19 Not all of the flags are covered here, man jot does a good job explaining them.</description>

      <title>Intersection Observer API</title>
      <link>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/intersection-observer-api/</link>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/intersection-observer-api/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the Intersection Observer API. It allows us to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document&amp;rsquo;s viewport.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see a small example:
// Create the observer and pass it a callback function. // The callback will run whenever a threshold is crossed. var options = { root: document.querySelector(&amp;#39;#scrollArea&amp;#39;), rootMargin: &amp;#39;0px&amp;#39;, threshold: 1.0 } var observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options); // Watch this element, please: var target = document.</description>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/at-command/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the at command. It allows us to schedule commands to be executed at a later time.
$ echo &amp;#34;bla&amp;#34; | at now + 5 minutes or if you want to execute commands from a file later on:
$ at -f path/to/file 9:30 PM Tue We can type atq to see existing jobs. For more information check man or tldr, it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting suite of commands.</description>

      <title>The ps -o flag</title>
      <link>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/ps-option/</link>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/ps-option/</guid>
      <description>The ps command is well known for displaying process information, but it was only recently that I found out about the useful -o flag. What this flag does is display the information about one or more selected headers.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example where we display the rss (Resident Set Size) for the process with pid 5380:
$ ps -o rss -p 5380 RSS 1784  rss represents the real memory, that is, the process&amp;rsquo;s memory that is held in RAM.</description>

      <title>Vim :normal</title>
      <link>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/vim-normal-command/</link>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/vim-normal-command/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes it is useful to use the :normal command in VIM, what it does is accept a sequence of keys and pretend they were typed in normal mode.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this works with a quick example. Suppose we have a file like the following:
1 abc,123 2 bcd,4 3 cde,54321 4 def,88 And we want the end result to be:
hash[&amp;#34;abc&amp;#34;] = 123 hash[&amp;#34;bcd&amp;#34;] = 4 hash[&amp;#34;cde&amp;#34;] = 54321 hash[&amp;#34;def&amp;#34;] = 88 To solve this in one command we can select the lines we want to modify and use:</description>

      <title>Vim Repeat Substitute</title>

      <guid>https://todayilearned.dev/posts/vim-repeat-substitute/</guid>
      <description>TIL about the &amp;amp; command in Vim and how it can be used to repeat the last search and replace pattern.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this works with a quick example. Suppose we have a file like the following:
rock paper scissors rock paper scissors rock paper scissors And you want to replace the word rock with lizard just in the lines one and three (don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why). Normally I would do something like:</description>

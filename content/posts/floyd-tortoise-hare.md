TIL about [Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_Tortoise_and_Hare).

This algorithm is used to detect whether there is a cycle in a list, and given
that a cycle exists its starting point and the length of the cycle.

The algorithm can also be used to prove the existence of duplicate numbers in a
list.

The time complexity of this algorithm is linear: `O(n)`.<br/>
The space complexity of this algorithm is constant: `O(1)`.

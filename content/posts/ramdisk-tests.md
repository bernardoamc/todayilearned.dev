TIL about running tests through a spawned database instance off a RAM disk. This
has been applied for a long time, but completely flew under my radar. An early
example of this setup with Rails and MySQL can be seen [here](https://github.com/mezis/mrd).

The idea is to make your test databaseâ€™s storage live in memory instead of
on-disk since it makes for faster reads and writes, even when considering the
use of SSD.
